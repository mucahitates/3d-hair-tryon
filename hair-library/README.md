# Hair Library

This folder contains the hairstyle database used by the try-on system.

Each hairstyle includes:

- Anchor points for skull alignment
- Deformation weights
- Textures and preview images
- Metadata such as length, style, and category

These assets are used by the AI pipeline to fit hairstyles onto user head models.
